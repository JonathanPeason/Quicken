# QuickenContacts

## Test Requirments 
Brand Marketing Code Test

Purpose This code test is designed to offer you a chance to show off your technical capabilities in a real-world way. The challenge presented here represents a cross-section of the type of work our team is typically accountable for at any given moment.

The Challenge As a business that is highly dependent on maintaining great communication with our clients, we would like for you to build a basic contact list page /app. In it, you will need to pull data from an existing mock endpoint, render to the page a table that displays all available information, and includes a mock form with basic validation and submit button to add a new contact. As this would be an internal app, it does not need to conform to any existing external brand styles.

Requirements This page should be built out using Angular 7 or above. This page should be fully responsive and mobile friendly. The project should include passing unit tests. The code for this should be saved to GitHub or similar service (GitLab, BitBucket, etc). The table data should be dynamic and pull it's content from http://demo5838836.mockable.io/contact The form on the page should contain the following fields First Name Last Name Company Email Phone Address The form on the page should display an error should any of the fields be blank. The form should display an error should it not adhere to a standard email format (i.e. username@domain.tld) The form should display a message indicating success when the submit button is pressed and all fields pass validation. On successful submission, the page should serialize the inputs and post the output to console.log().

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.6.
